# Stock Analysis with VBA
>Analyzing data with VBA to investigate the performance of green stocks

## Overview of Project
>To complete the objective, we will "refactor" or modify the All Stock Analysis Dataset by adding initial VBA starter code that loops through all the data. We'll find out if the VBA starter code refactoring succeeded in making the VBA script execute more rapidly. By lowering the number of actions the code does, utilizing less memory, or enhancing its logic to make it clearer, we wish to boost the code's efficiency in this challenge.

### Refactored VBA Code
>Using our skills we learned with VBA, in this challenge you must "refactor" or edit the starter code provided in  to loop through all the data and collect the information needed. You'll then will be able to tell whether effectively restructuring your code made the VBA script run faster. It runs more quickly now that I have refactored the code below.

### Elapsed Time for 2017 & 2018
>We obtained an elapsed run time for each year, which is listed below our results, after running a comprehensive 2017 and 2018 Data Stock Analysis.

## Results

>-In order for Steve to analyze a larger dataset quickly, we refactored the scripts to run more quickly in VBA

>-Containing these newly constructed macros, the table with an analysis for each year is easily visible

>-The analysis can be conducted for any year using updated macros

## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring codes

>-The run time of the macros is shortened by code refactoring.

>-It makes it simpler for future users to comprehend and read the code.

>-Refactoring the code makes adding new features simpler and reduces the chances of future issues.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Codes

>-Testing results may be impacted by the refactoring process

>-Refactoring larger, more complex codes could be challenging.

>-Refactoring codes could be very time-consuming.The time it might take to finish the process might be unknown to you and take you on a path that would lead you to  no where.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

>-A code that is arranged precisely is always simple to alter, comprehend, and maintain. You want a code that is clean and not cluttered. Paying close attention to the details early on in the refactoring process will help you prevent problems later.
